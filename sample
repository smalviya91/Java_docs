I have always highly regarded you as a supervisor and value your opinion. However, I am writing to provide you with information regarding why I believe the evaluation I received for my work performance is not upto the expectation. My evaluation on February 20th contained performance ratings that were less than satisfactory. I believe that my performance as an employee of this organization for the one and half years has always been exemplary.  

I have implemented several new and critical business functionalities in simplest possible way possible. For example,
1) Implemnted core functionality and typical business rules of critical payment module(GPS).
2) Took initiative many times to share knowledge within the team. For example give presentation on Logger and CBE at very initial phase of project, Prepared documents on Jenkins based   on my learning for the team.
3) Implemnted several new approach very first in the team like Do while loop in mule, Cache management, Lookup function in dwl and many more.

I have a perfect attendance record and am always willing to go the 'extra mile' to uphold the reputation of this company. I was always available whenever required even on weekends. Our working relationship is extremely important to me, and I am confident that you will consider my position in this matter. I will continue to do my best and am willing to listen to any suggestions you may have. I would welcome a meeting to discuss the situation. Thank you for your reconsideration.
