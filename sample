Signing off from Capgemini!!!


Hello All,

I’ve had an impressive number of years with the Capgemini. The time spent with my team and colleagues have been memorable. After much reflection, I have chosen to bid adieu to pursue new challenges in my field of interest.
I would like to mention that it has been great to interact with every one of you on a personal and a professional level. The good times we’ve shared will always be etched in my memory. We may have had our share of disparity of opinions, but that was all in good faith. Even though I am excited about my new role, every person I’ve worked with will be missed sorely.
However, now it is time for me to move on to new opportunities. Therefore, I wish to say let’s stay connected in the future rather than saying goodbye. I will miss your enthusiasm and support and continued cooperation. Nevertheless, this is just the beginning of a new chapter. My personal contact number is +91-9168922822, and you can stay connected with me on my personal email ID shailendramalviya33@gmail.com.

Once again, I wish my colleagues a bright future and success for the entire organization. I would like to extend my best wishes to the entire firm.

 
Sincerely,
Shailendra Malviya
